\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

In the ever evolving context of Internet technologies in general, and
Peer-to-Peer technologies in particular, this work presented approaches on
measuring protocol parameters and providing improvements with particular focus
on performance. Considering the past decade evolution of Peer-to-Peer
technology, we have been using lessons learned in the past years to augment
existing protocols or design and implement new ones, while keeping the grip on
running realistic trials and collecting and interpreting protocol parameters.

Our measurements analysis has been centered at protocol level, with focus on
peer protocols. We didn't focus on providing an overall swarm view, but rather
a client-centric analysis. Information provided by clients had bee subject to
analysis -- protocol parameters such as download rate, upload rate, peer
connections, protocol events are at the center of the analysis. An
``individualistic'' client-centric approach was preferred against an overall
swarm-centric one.

Recognizing the immense impact of the BitTorrent protocol, most of the
measurements and improvements presented have made use of BitTorrent
architecture and specifics. BitTorrent protocol message analysis, protocol
parameters, streaming updates, tracker overlays, automating client actions
have formed the primary set of activities used in this work.

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:conclusion:contributions}

The work described in this thesis provided significant contributions in
Internet technology and Peer-to-Peer technology. The research and engineering
activities described provide updates to measurement and evaluation methods and
existing protocols used in Peer-to-Peer systems. With focus on client-centric
behavior and performance evaluation, the contributions highlighted below
amount to valuable progress in analysing and improving Peer-to-Peer protocols
and applications.

Contributions of this thesis range from infrastructure building and automation
to protocol designs and implementations and streaming experiments. Main
contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item development of a fully automated and scalable infrastructure for
  Peer-to-Peer experiments;
  \item the use of virtualization technology in the context of Peer-to-Peer
  systems;
  \item proving scalable use of OpenVZ solutions for providing a realistic
  infrastructure;
  \item undertaking a set of approaches to simulating connection dropouts in
  BitTorrent environments;
  \item proposal of metrics for evaluation of virtualization solutions;
  \item design, development and incorporation of a BitTorrent logging library;
  \item updates and patches have been applied to existing BitTorrent clients;
  \item isolation and definition of protocol messages types and protocol
  parameters specific to Peer-to-Peer systems;
  \item design and development of an automated framework for extracting,
  processing and analysing protocol data for BitTorrent implementations;
  \item development of a protocol parameter parsing and analysis engine to
  provide an in depth look at information provided by client log files;
  \item proposal of a formal context for evaluation of BitTorrent clients
  based on measured protocol parameters;
  \item design and implementation of a novel protocol for swarm unification in
  BitTorrent environment;
  \item design and implementation of a multiparty protocol in the Linux
  kernel;
  \item creation of a user-space implementation and test suite for the
  multiparty protocol;
  \item providing streaming support to the popular libtorrent implementation;
  \item providing live user centric experiments regarding Peer-to-Peer;
  technology;
  \item analysis and monitoring of BitTorrent streaming;
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion:future}

As is the case with improvements, updates and extensions, no work could ever
be complete. Continuous protocol evolution, the ever expanding Internet, new
user request request further updating. At the same time, current approaches
must be pushed towards a larger crowd, high quality formal evaluations and
increased reliability.

The multiparty protocol design and implementation in the Linux kernel has to
be completed, tested, evaluated. Current goal is to push for a mainline
integration, albeit in connection with the standardisation effort taking
place. The implementation presented, together with swift are part of a draft
that is to be submitted to IETF for standardisation, as a PPSP (Peer-to-Peer
Streaming Protocol).

Formal evaluation of Peer-to-Peer parameters, as highlighted in the final part
of Chapter~\ref{chapter:proto-measure} should be improved. Currently the
defined model provides little insight on what are the bottleneck and
problematic points where the experimenter should insist and focus his/her
actions.

On par with the formal evaluation of Peer-to-Peer parameters is the
Peer-to-Peer streaming versus classical distribution activity mentioned in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:multimedia-dist}. The focus of the LivingLab is
providing sound comparison between the two updates and, based on that, provide
advice regarding improvement of streaming extensions.

The exciting and ever-evolving context of Peer-to-Peer systems offers a
plethora of possibilities for further work on measuring and improving
protocols. While primarily aiming to enhance current efforts, new research
directions and challenges may be paved.
