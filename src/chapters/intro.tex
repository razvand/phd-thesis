\textit{``Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast.'' -- Kent Beck}

Technology is strongly related to progress. As time goes, technology is the
prime ingredient for progress and progress forces technology to adapt itself,
to become bettter and more useful, to surpass its original design and provide
new outcomes.

Computer Science and Computer Engineering are among the most dynamic fields of
human knowledge with continuous transformation of the technology, principles
and scope it enables.

Among the myriad of inventions, discoveries and contributions to the
development of human civilization, the Internet stands out as one of the
most impressive and extraordinary. With only a few decades of existence, the
Internet has managed to provide the means for uniting the entire planet, for
ensuring access to knowledge, information and digital resources. The Internet
is also a catalyst for all major technological advances in many other fields
of study where researchers and engieers alike have been challenged to provide
better services, better connectivity, better user experience, better
performance and increased diversity.

On the frontier between two millennia, when the Internet had become a main
stream and de facto service, a new technology emerged, fulfilling the need for
data exchange among edge users: Peer-to-Peer Systems.

The exploding evolution of the Internet had provided users everywhere with
higher and higher bandwidth. The similarly explosive evolution of computer
technology ensured faster CPUs, larger hard disks, more memory. As even fringe
users had access to a good quality resources, the need to easily interconnect
and share information became preminent. Peer-to-Peer Systems thus filled the
vacuum technological space enabled by the ever progressing Internet techology.
