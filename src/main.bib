abstract = {Peer-to-Peer protocols currently form the most heavily used protocol class in the Internet, with BitTorrent, the most popular protocol for content distribution, as its flagship. A high number of studies and investigations have been undertaken to measure, analyse and improve the inner workings of the BitTorrent protocol. Approaches such as tracker message analysis, network probing and packet sniffing have been deployed to understand and enhance BitTorrent's internal behaviour. In this paper we present a novel approach that aims to collect, process and analyse large amounts of local peer information in BitTorrent swarms. We classify the information as periodic status information able to be monitored in real time and as verbose logging information to be used for subsequent analysis. We have designed and implemented a retrieval, storage and presentation infrastructure that enables easy analysis of BitTorrent protocol internals. Our approach can be employed both as a comparison tool, as well as a measurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation influence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance. We base our approach on a framework that allows easy swarm creation and control for different BitTorrent clients. With the help of a virtualized infrastructure and a client-server software layer we are able to create, command and manage large sized BitTorrent swarms. The framework allows a user to run, schedule, start, stop clients within a swarm and collect information regarding their behavior.},

abstract = {In the last decade, file sharing systems have generally been dominated by P2P solutions. Whereas email and HTTP have been the ``killer apps'' of the earlier Internet, a large percentage of the current Internet backbone traffic is BitTorrent traffic. BitTorrent has proven to be the perfect file sharing solution for a decentralized Internet, moving the burden from central servers to each individual station and maximizing network performance by enabling unused communication paths between clients. Although there have been extensive studies regarding the performance of the BitTorrent protocol and the impact of network and human factors on the overall transfer quality, there has been little interest in evaluating, comparing and analyzing current real world implementations. With hundreds of BitTorrent clients, each applying different algorithms and performance optimization techniques, we consider evaluating and comparing various implementations an important issue. In this paper, we present a BitTorrent performance evaluation infrastructure that we are using with two purposes: to test and compare current real world BitTorrent implementations and to simulate complex BitTorrent swarms. Our infrastructure consists of a virtualized environment simulating complete P2P nodes and a fully automated framework. For relevant use, different existing BitTorrent clients have been instrumented to output transfer status data and extensive logging information.},

This research identifies key features which make Linux Containers a viable solution for large-scale Peer-to-Peer virtualized infrastructures. Host resource utilization and swarm performance are evaluated for different swarm sizes, finding correlations between the virtualization solution settings and the impact on various host and peer parameters. The limits of Linux Containers are explored through experimental research, identifying directions for improving Peer-to-Peer testing in virtualized environments.},

The advent of virtualization allows consolidation of multiple applications into virtual containers hosted on a single or multiple physical servers. However, this poses new challenges, including choosing the right virtualization technology and consolidation configuration for a particular set of applications. In this paper, we evaluate two representative virtualization technologies, Xen and OpenVZ, in various configurations. We consolidate one or more multi-tiered systems onto one or two nodes and drive the system with an auction workload called RUBiS. We compare both technologies with a base system in terms of application performance, resource consumption, scalability, low-level system metrics like cache misses and virtualization-specific metrics like Domain-0 consumption in Xen. Our experiments indicate that the average response time can increase by over 400\% in Xen and only a modest 100\% in OpenVZ as the number of application instances grows from one to four. This large discrepancy is caused by the higher virtualization overhead in Xen, which is likely due to higher L2 cache misses and misses per instruction. A similar trend is observed in CPU consumptions of virtual containers. We present an overhead analysis with kernel-symbol-specific information generated by Oprofile.}},

Whereas email and HTTP have been the ``killer apps'' of the earlier Internet, a large percentage of the current Internet backbone traffic is BitTorrent traffic. BitTorrent has proven to be the perfect file sharing solution for a decentralized Internet, moving the burden from central servers to each individual station and maximizing network performance by enabling unused communication paths between clients. Although there have been extensive studies regarding the performance of the BitTorrent protocol and the impact of network and human factors on the overall transfer quality, there has been little interest in evaluating, comparing and analyzing current real world implementations. With hundreds of BitTorrent clients, each applying different algorithms and performance optimization techniques, we consider evaluating and comparing various implementations an important issue. In this paper, we present a BitTorrent performance evaluation infrastructure that we are using with two purposes: to test and compare current real world BitTorrent implementations and to simulate complex BitTorrent swarms. Our infrastructure consists of a virtualized environment simulating complete P2P nodes and a fully automated framework. For relevant use, different existing BitTorrent clients have been instrumented to output transfer status data and extensive logging information.},

    abstract = {{Server consolidation has become an integral part of IT planning to reduce cost and improve efficiency in today's enterprise data centers. The advent of virtualization allows consolidation of multiple applications into virtual containers hosted on a single or multiple physical servers. However, this poses new challenges, including choosing the right virtualization technology and consolidation configuration for a particular set of applications. In this paper, we evaluate two representative virtualization technologies, Xen and OpenVZ, in various configurations. We consolidate one or more multi-tiered systems onto one or two nodes and drive the system with an auction workload called RUBiS. We compare both technologies with a base system in terms of application performance, resource consumption, scalability, low-level system metrics like cache misses and virtualization-specific metrics like Domain-0 consumption in Xen. Our experiments indicate that the average response time can increase by over 400\% in Xen and only a modest 100\% in OpenVZ as the number of application instances grows from one to four. This large discrepancy is caused by the higher virtualization overhead in Xen, which is likely due to higher L2 cache misses and misses per instruction. A similar trend is observed in CPU consumptions of virtual containers. We present an overhead analysis with kernel-symbol-specific information generated by Oprofile.}},

Traditional client-server based video streaming solutions incur expensive bandwidth provision cost on the server. {Peer-to-Peer} ({P2P}) networking is a new paradigm to build distributed network applications. Recently, several {P2P} streaming systems have been deployed to provide live and on-demand video streaming services on the Internet at low server cost. In this paper, we provide a survey on the existing {P2P} solutions for live and on-demand video streaming. Representative {P2P} streaming systems, including tree, multi-tree and mesh based systems are introduced. We describe the challenges and solutions of providing live and on-demand video streaming in {P2P} environment. Open research issues on {P2P} video streaming are also discussed.},
