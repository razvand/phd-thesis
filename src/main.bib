@article{bt-swarm-analysis,
	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer protocols currently form the most heavily used protocol class in the Internet, with BitTorrent, the most popular protocol for content distribution, as its flagship. A high number of studies and investigations have been undertaken to measure, analyse and improve the inner workings of the BitTorrent protocol. Approaches such as tracker message analysis, network probing and packet sniffing have been deployed to understand and enhance BitTorrent's internal behaviour. In this paper we present a novel approach that aims to collect, process and analyse large amounts of local peer information in BitTorrent swarms. We classify the information as periodic status information able to be monitored in real time and as verbose logging information to be used for subsequent analysis. We have designed and implemented a retrieval, storage and presentation infrastructure that enables easy analysis of BitTorrent protocol internals. Our approach can be employed both as a comparison tool, as well as a measurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation influence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance. We base our approach on a framework that allows easy swarm creation and control for different BitTorrent clients. With the help of a virtualized infrastructure and a client-server software layer we are able to create, command and manage large sized BitTorrent swarms. The framework allows a user to run, schedule, start, stop clients within a swarm and collect information regarding their behavior.},

@article{bt-vi,
	abstract = {In the last decade, file sharing systems have generally been dominated by P2P solutions. Whereas email and HTTP have been the ``killer apps'' of the earlier Internet, a large percentage of the current Internet backbone traffic is BitTorrent traffic. BitTorrent has proven to be the perfect file sharing solution for a decentralized Internet, moving the burden from central servers to each individual station and maximizing network performance by enabling unused communication paths between clients. Although there have been extensive studies regarding the performance of the BitTorrent protocol and the impact of network and human factors on the overall transfer quality, there has been little interest in evaluating, comparing and analyzing current real world implementations. With hundreds of BitTorrent clients, each applying different algorithms and performance optimization techniques, we consider evaluating and comparing various implementations an important issue. In this paper, we present a BitTorrent performance evaluation infrastructure that we are using with two purposes: to test and compare current real world BitTorrent implementations and to simulate complex BitTorrent swarms. Our infrastructure consists of a virtualized environment simulating complete P2P nodes and a fully automated framework. For relevant use, different existing BitTorrent clients have been instrumented to output transfer status data and extensive logging information.},

@techreport{eval-virt-performance,
	abstract = {{Server consolidation has become an integral part of IT planning to reduce cost and improve efficiency in today's enterprise data centers. The advent of virtualization allows consolidation of multiple applications into virtual containers hosted on a single or multiple physical servers. However, this poses new challenges, including choosing the right virtualization technology and consolidation configuration for a particular set of applications. In this paper, we evaluate two representative virtualization technologies, Xen and OpenVZ, in various configurations. We consolidate one or more multi-tiered systems onto one or two nodes and drive the system with an auction workload called RUBiS. We compare both technologies with a base system in terms of application performance, resource consumption, scalability, low-level system metrics like cache misses and virtualization-specific metrics like Domain-0 consumption in Xen. Our experiments indicate that the average response time can increase by over 400\% in Xen and only a modest 100\% in OpenVZ as the number of application instances grows from one to four. This large discrepancy is caused by the higher virtualization overhead in Xen, which is likely due to higher L2 cache misses and misses per instruction. A similar trend is observed in CPU consumptions of virtual containers. We present an overhead analysis with kernel-symbol-specific information generated by Oprofile.}},

@book{Katsaros2009,
	abstract = {In the past few years numerous P2P file-sharing and content distribution systems have been designed, implemented, and evaluated via simulations, real world measurements, and mathematical analysis. Yet, only few of them have stood the test of time and gained wide user acceptance. BitTorrent is the one that holds the lion's share among them and the reasons behind its success have been studied to a great extent with interesting results. Nevertheless, even though P2P content distribution remains one of the most active research areas, little progress has been made towards the study of the BitTorrent protocol (and its variations), in a fully controllable and realistic simulation environment. In this paper we describe and analyze a full-featured and extensible implementation of BitTorrent for the OMNeT++ simulation platform. Moreover, since we aim at realistic simulations, we present our enhancements on a popular conversion tool for practical Internet topologies, as well as our churn generator that is based on the analysis of real BitTorrent traces. Finally, we set forth the results from the evaluation of our prototype implementation regarding resource demands under different simulation scenarios.},

@book{Luo2010,
	abstract = {The prior studies setup the churn model by measuring the historical logs or records of a P2P network, and treat it as one whole black-box without understanding the inside of peer's population. The metrics used to characterize the churn is distributions of the node session lengths and arrival intervals. We investigate churn in a higher level point of view, and find that modeling it based on the global geographical distribution of peer nodes will result in a system which explain the fluctuation and cyclic phenomenon of network size. This model considers the user behavior pattern into account. Then we provide a Matlab tools that can provide churn events according to this model. From the output events of simulation, we do see some more future things than other models. We might expect or predict when and what nodes would return back, as well as when and what nodes would disappear at high possibility. So it is useful when designing a system optimized both to the pass and the future, which could reduce the overhead of the maintenance of underlying overlay network of DHTs and lower the redundant level of replications for P2P storage system.},

@inproceedings{packet-alter,
	abstract = {The exponential growth of the Internet during the last two decades has enabled the development of a wide variety of protocols and algorithms for efficient transfer of information. As most of the current Internet is based on the Internet Protocol (IP), packet delivery is "best effort". Certain packets may be dropped, altered, reordered or delayed. When deploying a new protocol or network solution, one needs to analyze and estimated the performance of that solution on the Internet. As the size and decentralized nature of the Internet renders such an analysis difficult, network emulators have been employed to create a simulated environment for packets running through the network. In this paper we present a flexible and extensible software network emulator that allows a great diversity of packet altering techniques. Our current implementation is running on Linux hosts only but its design allows easy porting to other platforms.},

@inproceedings{tracker-overlay,
	abstract = {The deployment of the BitTorrent protocol in the early 2000s has meant a significant shift in Peer-to-Peer technologies. Currently the most heavily used protocol in the Internet core, the BitTorrent protocol has sparked numerous implementations, commercial entities and research interest. In this paper, we present a mechanism that allows integration of disparate swarms that share the same content. We've designed and implemented a novel inter-tracker protocol, dubbed TSUP, that allows trackers to share peer information, distribute it to clients and enable swarm unification. The protocol forms the basis for putting together small swarms into large, healthy ones with reduced performance overhead. Our work achieves its goals to increase the number of peers in a swarm and proves that the TSUP incurred overhead is minimal.},

In this paper we present a framework that allows easy swarm creation and control for different BitTorrent clients. With the help of a virtualized infrastructure and a client-server software layer we are able to create, command and manage large sized BitTorrent swarms. The framework allows a user to run, schedule, start, stop clients within a swarm and collect information regarding their behavior.},

A high number of studies and investigations have been undertaken to measure, analyse and improve the inner workings of the BitTorrent protocol. Approaches such as tracker message analysis, network probing and packet sniffing have been deployed to understand and enhance BitTorrent's internal behaviour. In this paper we present a novel approach that aims to collect, process and analyse large amounts of local peer information in BitTorrent swarms. We classify the information as periodic status information able to be monitored in real time and as verbose logging information to be used for subsequent analysis. We have designed and implemented a retrieval, storage and presentation infrastructure that enables easy analysis of BitTorrent protocol internals. Our approach can be employed both as a comparison tool, as well as a measurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation influence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance.},
